[Install and set up LaTeX for VSCode](https://medium.com/@erencanbulut/boost-your-latex-workflow-with-vs-code-and-github-f346b74677be)

This repository contains a LaTeX folder where you can work in the .tex file, and view the pdf. Python is also included with a requirements.txt for Sympy to assist with mathematics - an example usage is included for deriving the quadratic formula. The gitignore is setup to not ignore the pdf, but to ignore most of the auxillary created LaTeX files.
